DayZ Community Project
=========================

This is a Community Dayz project.

This would not be possible without the work of Rocket and Guru Abdul. We also use the fantastic cPBO from Kegetys (www.kegetys.fi) and wget for Windows by the GnuWin32 team (gnuwin32.sourceforge.net).

**NOTE**: No support is implied or offered for pirated copies of ArmA 2.
